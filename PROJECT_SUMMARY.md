## Files Created:

### Executable and Core Files:
- ChineseDebloater_v2.exe (10.3 MB) - Main executable
- ChineseDebloater.py - Improved source code
- chinese_debloater.log - Application log (created when running)

### Build Files:
- uild.bat - Automated build script
- setup_adb.bat - ADB setup helper
- ChineseDebloater_v2.spec - PyInstaller specification
- README.md - Comprehensive user guide

### Runtime Files (created during use):
- last_debloat_backup.json - Auto-backup of debloated apps
- chinese_apps_backup_[timestamp].json - Manual backups

## Technical Specifications:

### Dependencies:
- Python 3.7+ (built-in modules only)
- tkinter (GUI framework)
- subprocess (ADB command execution)
- threading (background operations)
- json (backup/restore data)
- logging (error tracking)

### External Requirements:
- Android SDK Platform Tools (for ADB)
- AAPT (Android Asset Packaging Tool)

### Tested Platform:
- Windows 10/11
- Target Device: Vivo X200S with OriginOS 5

## Usage Summary:

1. **Setup**: Install Android SDK Platform Tools, enable USB debugging
2. **Connect**: Connect Vivo X200S via USB, authorize computer
3. **Scan**: Launch app, click 'Scan for Chinese Apps'
4. **Review**: Check detected apps in the table
5. **Debloat**: Click 'Debloat Selected Apps', confirm operation
6. **Reboot**: Restart device for changes to take effect

## Safety Notes:
- Apps are uninstalled for current user only (not system-wide)
- App data is preserved
- Apps can be restored anytime
- Automatic backup ensures recovery is possible

## Next Steps:
1. Test the executable with your Vivo X200S
2. Ensure ADB is properly set up (use setup_adb.bat if needed)
3. Enable USB debugging on your device
4. Run a scan to see detected Chinese apps
5. Review the apps carefully before debloating
6. Always reboot after debloating

The improved version provides a much safer, user-friendly, and feature-rich experience compared to the original command-line version.

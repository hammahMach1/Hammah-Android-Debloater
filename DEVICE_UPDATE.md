The core functionality for detecting and removing Chinese apps via ADB is 
device-agnostic and works on any Android device with USB debugging enabled.

The Vivo X200S likely has:
- Newer version of OriginOS (possibly OriginOS 4 or 5)
- Similar bloatware patterns as other Vivo devices
- Same ADB debloating capabilities

Your Chinese Debloater is ready for the Vivo X200S! 📱✨
